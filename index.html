      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>I’m Fernando Althann — also known online as <strong>FernandVonAlthann</strong>. Born in November 2003 in Mexico. I migrated to the U.S. in 2008, seeking safety and opportunity. My early years were spent moving throughout California. Despite the adversity, I never stopped dreaming of becoming an astronaut, a cop, a soldier, and a doctor.</p>

      <p>Throughout middle and high school, I began my transformation — from failing grades and social isolation to straight As, International Baccalaureate courses, varsity track and football, and eventually, Academic Decathlon and Science Olympiad. I studied 25 languages and 6 dialects on my own, seeking knowledge as a way out. A high school chemistry teacher inspired me to believe in myself again, helping ignite a passion for science, language, and discipline.</p>

      <p>In community college, I earned 6 degrees and completed 111 credits with a 3.8 GPA and highest honors. As Director of Legislation for the student government and delegate to the SSCCC, I passed bills, led teams, and helped reform statewide policy. I was accepted to UCLA as a TAP Honors student, where I became one of 300 College Corps Fellows and UCLA’s official ambassador. I interned, studied, worked full-time, and fought for my legal status through SIJS, gaining my social security card and lawful presence — a dream 12 years in the making.</p>

      <p>While at UCLA, I co-founded <strong>Glycemix</strong>, an AI-powered diabetes app. I worked on backend systems with Supabase, React Native, and full-stack deployment tools. I also studied Artificial Intelligence and completed advanced CS projects like LLM development and RAG-KG agents, balancing my ambition with recovery from decades of trauma and pressure. I graduated from UCLA with a B.A. in Linguistics & Computer Science, shaped by advocacy, legal battles, and service.</p>

      <p>Today, I’m a Deputy Sheriff Trainee for Riverside County. I’m also completing the LVN program at College of the Desert to serve the Red Cross as a nurse. I plan to pursue a master’s in computer science, and eventually a Ph.D., so I can become a professor who challenges students the way my mentors did for me.</p>
